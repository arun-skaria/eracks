Postmortem 9/17/16, dead.

Still needed:

migrate - faults:

./manage.py migrate -l
django.db.migrations.graph.NodeNotFoundError: Migration social_auth.0003_auto_20151227_1809 dependencies reference nonexistent parent node (u'default', u'0002_auto_20150210_1402')

No amount of migration commands work, iuncluding fake, zero, etc - app is:
./manage.py migrate --fake social.apps.django_app.default zero

FUBAR.

Solutions:
- delete two parallel / duplicated social migrations 2 & 3.
- move already-applied but faulting auth migration to 'old'
- userena: already applied, so --fake it - note you have to specify the number, otherwise it BACKS OUT the migrations.

Who wrote this sh*t?

- Also had to --fake 0001 initial guardian migration
- had to --fake social_auth 0003

Migrations pass, still not working.

p - gunicorn hosed - run manually, works. no more --debug, but that's not the only thing.
d - wysiwyg - django-wysiwyg, needed by quickpages - 500 error in admin.
d - xvfb for testing?
