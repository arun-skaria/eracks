Prod upgrade steps performed today:

- used git log to determine recent changes to requirements.txt

- update django-grappelli manually to new version sepcified in requirements.txt

- double check django-userena to version specied in git - 
    turns out they are both 2.01, we may now be able to go back to standard pip install in requirements

- used apt to install (in the OS) dependencies for pip install geoip to complete OK (Missing geoip.h)
    then pip-install geoip went ok
